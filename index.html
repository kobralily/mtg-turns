    <div class="begDiv">
      <h2>Beginning Phase</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="begDiv" id="untap">
			<h3>Untap Step</h3>

      <p>This is the first thing you do in a turn, and all of these are turn-based actions that don't use the stack</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>First:</strong> If there is phasing, the active player's permanents phase in or out simultaneously</li>
				<li><strong>Second:</strong> If there is a day/night cycle, the day or night designation is lost and the other is gained.
				<li><strong>Third:</strong> Any summoning sickness is lost</li>
				<li><strong>Fourth:</strong> The active player's permanents are untapped simultaneously</li>
			</ul>
    </div>

    <div class="begDiv" id="upkeep">
			<h3>Upkeep Step</h3>

      <p>The upkeep step doesnt have any required actions, its more like a window for you and opponents to take actions.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>First:</strong> Abilities that are triggered in the untap or the upkeep step are put on the stack</li>
				<li><strong>Second:</strong> The active player gets priority</li>
			</ul>
    </div>

    <div class="begDiv" id="draw">
			<h3>Draw Step</h3>

			<p>The active player draws a card from the top of their deck as a turn-based action.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>First:</strong> Abilities that are triggered from drawing that card are put on the stack</li>
				<li><strong>Second:</strong> The active player gets priority</li>
			</ul>

    </div>

		<div class="declare" id="dm1">
      <h3>Declare moving to Precombat Main Phase</h3>
			<p>This is essentially passing priority at the end of the draw step</p>
			<p>This isn't necessarily a rule, but it's a courtesy to mention whenever you are moving to a new phase to give the opponent a chance to respond.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="main1">

    <div id="divMain1" class="mainPhase">
      <h2>Precombat Main Phase</h2>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>First:</strong> The active player puts a lore counter on each Saga Enchantment they control. This is a turn based action and does not use the stack</li>
				<li><strong>Second:</strong> Abilities that trigger "At the beginning of the next main phase" or "precombat phase" are put on the stack</li>
				<li><strong>Third:</strong> Once that stack is empty, the active player gets priority to play any card type</li>
			</ul>

			<p>At this point, in the main phase, the active player may play their one land per turn, but this is not a step and does not use the stack. Spells and lands can be played in any order.</p>
      <p>The main phase has no steps, and ends once the active player and opponents have passed priority and the stack is empty.</p>
    </div>

		<div class="declare" id="dcombat">
      <h3>Declare moving to Combat</h3>
			<p>This is essentially passing priority at the end of the main phase.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="combat">

    <div class="combatDiv">
      <h2>Combat</h2>
    </div>

		<div class="combatDiv" id="begCombat">
      <h3>Beginning of Combat</h3>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>First:</strong> The opponent becomes the defending player. In a multiplayer game, the active player chooses an opponent as the "defending player"</li>
				<li><strong>Second:</strong> Abilities that trigger at the beginning of combat" are put on the stack</li>
				<li><strong>Third:</strong> The active player then gets priority before moving to the next step</li>
			</ul>
    </div>

    <div class="combatDiv" id="declareAttacks">
			<h3>Declare Attackers</h3>
      <p>Here, the active player delcares the creatures to attack. This does not use the stack.</p>
			<p>An opponent or an opponent's planeswalker must be selected for each creature's attack.</p>
			<p>The active player gets priority before moving to the next step.</p>
			<p><em>If no attackers are declared, the Declare Blockers and Combat Damage steps do not happen at all.</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class="combatDiv" id="declareBlocks">
      <h3>Declare Blockers</h3>
			<p>Here, the defending player(s) will declare their blockers.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong>First:</strong> The defending player(s) choose which creatures they control will block.</li>
				<li><strong>Second:</strong> For each attacking creature that is blocked, the active player chooses the damage assignment order</li>
				<li><strong>Third:</strong> Abilities that trigger off declaring blockers are put on the stack</li>
				<li><strong>Fourth:</strong> The active player gets priority</li>
			</ul>

    </div>

    <div class="combatDiv" id="resolveDmg">
			<h3>Combat Damage</h3>
			<p>If there is any creatures attacking or blocking with first strike or double strike, there is an extra preliminary combat damage step for the first strike damage.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>First:</strong> All attacking creatures (excl. first strikers) who have been blocked assign damage to their blockers</li>
					<li><strong>Second:</strong> All unblocked creatures assign damage to the defending player or planeswalker</li>
					<li><strong>Third:</strong> All defending creatures assign combat damage to their attackers</li>
					<li><strong>Fourth:</strong> All damage is dealt simultaneously</li>
					<li><strong>Fifth:</strong> Abilities that trigger on damage will go on the stack</li>
					<li><strong>Sixth:</strong> Active player gets priority</li>
				</ul>
    </div>

		<div class="combatDiv" id="endCombat">
			<h3>End of Combat</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>First:</strong> Abilities that trigger at the "end of combat" go on the stack</li>
				<li><strong>Second:</strong> The active player gets priority</li>
				<li><strong>Third:</strong> All creatures are removed from combat</li>
				<li><strong>Fourth:</strong> Effects that are "until end of combat" end</li>
			</ul>
	  </div>

		<div class="declare" id="dm2">
      <h3>Declare moving to Postcombat Main Phase</h3>
			<p>This is essentially passing priority at the end of the combat phase and will alert the opponent that creatures are being removed from combat and "end of combat" effects are ending, giving the opponent a chance to respond</p>
    </div>
</section>

<section id="main2">

  <div id="divMain2" class="mainPhase">
    <h2>Postcombat Main Phase</h2>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>First:</strong> Abilities that trigger "At the beginning of the next main phase" or "postcombat phase" are put on the stack</li>
			<li><strong>Second:</strong> Once the stack is empty, the active player gets priority to play any card type</li>
		</ul>

	<div class="declare">
    <h3>Declare moving to Ending Phase</h3>

		<h3>Beginning of End Step</h3>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>First:</strong> Abilities that trigger at the beginning of the end step or at the next end step are put on the stack</li>
			<li><strong>Second:</strong> The active player gets priority</li>
		</ul>
  </div>

  <div class="endDiv" id="cleanup">
		<h3>Cleanup Step</h3>
    <p>This is the last step that wraps up all the events of the turn before moving to the next player's turn.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>First:</strong> If the active player has more cards in hand than their maximum hand size, they must discard cards from their hand until they meet the maximum</li>
			<li><strong>Second:</strong> All these actions happen simultaneously: all damage marked on permanents is removed and "until end of turn" and "this turn" effects end</li>
			<li><strong>Third:</strong> No player receives priority during the cleanup step</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Now, the next player's turn begins, and the process restarts from the beginning</p>

<h3>Useful Definitions</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>The Active Player:</strong> the turn belongs to this player, i.e. it is that persons turn</li>
	<li><strong>Phase:</strong> A phase is essentially a section of a turn, and there are five phases in a magic turn</li>
	<li><strong>Step:</strong> A phase has a number of steps (or none at all) that a player must go through as part of the phase</li>
	<li><strong>Turn-Based Action:</strong> A phase has a number of steps (or none at all) that a player must go through as part of the phase</li>

	<li><strong>Priotity:</strong> A player may add a spell or activated abilitiy to the stack if that player has priority</li>
	<li><strong>State-Based Action:</strong> Just before any player gets priority, the game is checked for certain conditions. If either a creature being dealt lethal damage or the legend rule, the action of death/sacrifice will be taken immediately, and another check will be repeated</li>
	<li><strong>Land per Turn:</strong> A player may play one land per turn on only one of their main phases as their land per turn</li>
	<li><strong>Attacking Player:</strong> A player who is in the combat phase of their turn is the attacking player</li>
	<li><strong>Defending Player:</strong> A player becomes the defending player if the attacking player is attacking them or a planeswalker they control</li>
